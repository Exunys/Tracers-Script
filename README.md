# Simple Scripts

## About

Get the script [here](https://github.com/UbicastDev/ROBLOX-Tracer-Script/blob/main/Tracers).

- The more you execute the script, the laggier the game gets.

- The script can be executed by changing the modes, making the tracers visible / invisible and by executing the script again from your executor.

- I decided to make this script unobfuscated so that people can learn by reading and experimenting with the source code this script.

- This script has comments everywhere so that the user experimenting with the script can learn something.

- You can freely change any of the properties below to suit your needs.
