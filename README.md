# Tracer Script

## About

Get the script [here](https://github.com/UbicastDev/ROBLOX-Tracer-Script/blob/main/Tracers%20(UPDATED)).

I decided to make this script unobfuscated so that people can learn by reading and experimenting with the source code of this script. This script has comments everywhere so that the user experimenting with the script can learn something. You can freely change any of the properties in the script to suit your needs.

- [!] This script remains undetected and has been tested on games with an Anti-Cheat system.
- [!] This script only works on exploits that support the API refrence Drawing.
